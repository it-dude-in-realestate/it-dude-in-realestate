# Checklist Before Buying a Lot

This is a checklist for acquiring lots targeting real estate development (but it can be applicable as well for “buy and hold” strategy).    
I will use in this checklist Bexar county (San Antonio, TX).  
In the US, most counties have a GIS (Geographic Information System) and an open database of property taxes (that has critical information such as last 5 years of appraisal prices).  

1. Get a list of lots available. Your broker can set up an automatic query with certain parameters, such as the limit of your price range and minimum square feet.  
For the latter, a good size for a single family house is 5,000 sq ft. Certain builders can even build on a 3,000-4,000 sq ft.

2. Environment and initial deal breakers:
    -  Check address on FEMA, to make sure the lot is on Zone "X" (no flood). Outside Zone X, it is a deal breaker (IMO). https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home  
        - Addendum: Recently, a consortium is challenging FEMA studies and they have their own flood map. I do not think this is a deal breaker (at least for now, IMO). But it is worth it to check: https://floodfactor.com/  
    -  It is rare, but check if the lot is not part or near a superfund sites: https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live
    -  Check for bad septic tanks (TBD how to, at least it should show on the lot survey).
    -  Check if the lot is near a laundromat or dry-cleaning joint. They usually dump chemicals on the soil and contaminate 200-300 feet around them. 
    -  Check for the soil (*) TBD for a success criteria. If you have a builder, have them to visit the lot during the option period and/or look for adjacent constructions.

3. Check address in the county. Go to the property search site and look for the address. Sometimes the address is wrong and the database is incorrect. It is normal. If the county has an option, navigate using the map option. If the lot is not found, there is a possibility the lot is not legit. Check lot size (frontage desirably with 50'', certain counties make this as a minimum for construction). Check zoning, each county has its own code (you will need to study them for restrictions and how easy to be changed). Multiple family zonings are more desirable. Check the appraisal price if it matches the asking price. Check if property taxes are reasonable. Check how many times the lot has changed hands.  http://bexar.trueautomation.com/clientdb/PropertySearch.aspx?cid=110  
    - For “buy and hold” strategy: the evolution of the county appraisal price is a key metric. My lot in 78202 zipcode, it had 400% appraisal between 2016 and 2021. Usually, the more appreciation, the better - it shows the neighborhood is growing economically over time but pay attention if indeed there is more room for growth.  

4. Check for utilities if there is sewer + water. If not, each one will cost you around 7.5k of "impact fees" for each utility, around 15k per unit.   In Bexar County: https://www.saws.org/service/locates-service/ (for this particular website, you will need to create a login on https://locates.saws.org/locate/index.cfm). If the lot is really cheap, odds are there is not utilities. But I heard it is simple to setup as long as there are pipes in front of the property (look for adjacent constructions). A connection to wasteline alone, for example, in Bexar County is 5K + impact fees. Use this information to negotiate prices.

5. Check if the land has a survey. If not, make sure the seller is paying for one during the transaction, it usually costs $500-$1000. Sometimes, the survey is in the MLS (your broker can download it). The survey will tell about "easements", avoid them (easement is someone else has rights on a certain part of the lot (ie oil pipes, light posts, future sidewalks, etc). Each easement is registered with a "deed". There is a code on each deed that you can look up in the county. Certain "easements" can be removed or they are temporary. Easements are common for large lots. For San Antonio, one might find easements from this database: https://www.bexar.org/2950/Real-PropertyLand-Records . Austin, on other hand, has this information integrated with their GIS (see below on GIS).

6. Looking ahead for development. For each lot, look at the zip code and/or the map view. 
Give preference to more desirable locations (near schools, parks, commercial areas).  
Do the "comps", looking for new houses that you look to build and their selling price. This is the margin study viability that you need to make (this would be another checklist). 
But overall, the total cost of the development:
    - Lot (land, utilities, paperwork)
    - Construction “hard” costs (size x construction cost per sq ft)
    - Closing “soft cost” fees (title + 6% broker fees).

    The construction cost per sq ft varies wildly based on the city/county and how luxurious the construction is. The cheapest I found is $90/sq ft for San Antonio back in 2019.  
    In 2021-2022, prices are much higher. In 2019, Austin was $150-$160/sq ft. Finding the right builder is another checklist.

7. Check if the city has "plat" for the lot/neighborhood. "Plat" is an official county map, required for any construction. This is more difficult to obtain since there is no system in Bexar county. It costs around 10k to order one. Try to find if there is one during the transaction. If unknown, assume there is not.
When I bought a lot in 78202, they said there was no plat. When we bought a second lot in the same neighborhood, the other owner disclosed the plat during negotiation (the plat was from the year 1930). It was the same plat for both lots. It seems like a hit and miss. See item 5 above, sometimes the county has a plat in their land records.

8. Look for the GIS (Geographic Information System) of the neighborhood. For example, Bexar county has https://www.bcad.org/mapSearch/?cid=1 , the city of San Antonio has this one: https://gis.sanantonio.gov/DSD/OneStop/Index.html
Depending how advanced the system is, you can pull up easements, ordinances, water lines, zones, etc. 
I find very useful information reading all ordinances from the lot prior acquiring one.
